    "# Neural Networks Lesson 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology and Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Get excited, because we are going to build a Neural Network from the ground up. First, however, it is important to understand a couple of key data science topics before we get into building this.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a big dataset, we usually have one of three goals: $exploration,\\  classification,\\ and\\ inference$ With exploration, we have no real goal in making a particular guess for a response variable but we want to initially explore our data and see if there are any interesting relations between the variables so that we can later make a hypothesis about the data and possibly build a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "With classification, we are less concerned on how the variables relate to each other but would rather build something that can guess a response. For example, if we were trying to get the most accurate stock price predictions based off of previous prices and other factors, we care less about how our model works and more about getting the best possible fit to our model. Finally, inference is concerned about making completely new predictions based off of a new array of factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can probably guess where Neural Networks fit in. They make really good guesses into how data relates to a particular response. Thus, they are primarily used for classification. Understanding this, we can now take on a couple more big-picture items. If Neural Networks are used for classification, one has to identify a couple of things\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have to identify a response variable in your dataset. This is the thing you are interested in classifying. It could be stock prices, if someone will be a high or low performer, house prices, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After you have your response variable you will want to identify which factors in your dataset will help indicate the output. For example, if I was trying to predict how well you will do in this class, I might want factors like how much time you study each week, your grades in other classes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once you have identified these things, there are some interim steps such as cleaning your data so that it can be integrated into the Neural Network, but you are pretty much ready to train your neural network and be on your way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next few lessons, the above will not be too important, but if we are going to build an entire Neural Network, we should know when we use it, and the basic steps to employ it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now letâ€™s talk about the structure of Neural Networks.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In stats you probably built a linear regression prediction model. That was you had some response and you fit a couple of factors to the data in a linear manner. This might look familiar\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 ....$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where y was your response and $x_1, x_2,..x_n$ were your different factors you used to predict $\\hat{y}$. I bring this up to rejog your memory on building models to predict a response. I also bring it up because when people first hear \"Neural Network\" they sometimes shut down thinking, this is going to be super complicated and I have no prior knowledge on this concept. In reality, Neural networks are just another statistical model that have a more visual representation that is based on the human brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "Aren't you glad you are at the academy where they make you take biology even as a CS major. Now it might have some use. The smallest unit in a neural network is the Neuron based on neurons in our brain. Here is a neural network neuron and a biological one.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./neuron.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "AHHHHHH scary picture with math that I don't understand. Well let's break it down. The Neuron will be the first object we build in python. The Neuron takes in a series of numerical inputs. It has an array of predefined weights one coressponding to each input. It then takes the dot product between these inputs and the weights and outputs it. A lot of times we will also have an $activation \\ function$ that goes we will put the dot product into to get the final output. You will read all about this in Negnivitsky. Here is everything above in math language. Take a second to go through and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{W} = Weight\\ vector$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{I} = Input\\ vector$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta = Bias$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our output looks like without an activation function\n",
    "\n",
    "$output = \\vec{W}\\cdot\\vec{I} - \\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our output looks like with an activation function\n",
    "\n",
    "$output = activationfunction(\\vec{W}\\cdot\\vec{I} - \\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, all that is going to happen is we are going to send some values into a bunch of these neurons and the neurons will calculate an output as the weighted sum of the Weights (and bias) and the input vector.  We will go over this in more detail with the feed forward algorithm in tomorrow's lesson.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./network.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in this image we are going to have multiple neurons in layers which will make up our network.  The neurons at each level each take all of the outputs for either the input data (on the first layer) or the outputs from the neurons on previous layers.  This repeats through each of the middle layers of neurons, called hidden layers, until you get to the final layer which then compresses these outputs into one or more outputs.  \n"
